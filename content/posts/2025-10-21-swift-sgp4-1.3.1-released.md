Version **1.3.1** of [SPGKit](https://github.com/csanfilippo/swift-sgp4) has been released.

This update resolves a build configuration issue that affected projects using **Swift 5.9**.  
In previous versions, the package failed to compile because the Swift Package Manager setup did not correctly handle the interoperability between Swift and C++ sources. As a result, users on Swift 5.9 encountered build errors when integrating the library.

The fix applies the proper configuration for Swift/C++ interop, following the approach described in the [Swift documentation](https://www.swift.org/documentation/cxx-interop/project-build-setup/). With this adjustment, the package now builds successfully on Swift 5.9 and later.

As part of this change, the **minimum supported Swift version is now 5.9**.  
No other functionality has been modified in this release.
