Iâ€™m happy to share something Iâ€™ve been working on: **aral**, a Kotlin Multiplatform library for parsing XML.

## The motivation

XML may not be the trendiest format, but it remains deeply embedded in the systems we rely on every day â€” from configuration files to data exchanges in healthcare, finance, and beyond.

When building with Kotlin Multiplatform, I found the existing XML tooling either too heavy or too tied to a single platform. What I wanted was something **lightweight, predictable, and consistent across environments**. That gap is what led to aral.

## The idea

aral takes a **push-based approach**: it emits a stream of events as the document is read.

This design keeps the library small and efficient, while giving developers the flexibility to decide how to handle the data. Itâ€™s not about doing everything â€” itâ€™s about doing one thing well, and doing it everywhere Kotlin runs.

## The philosophy

aral is built on three principles:

- **Clarity**: a simple, event-driven API
- **Consistency**: the same behavior across Android, iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS
- **Minimalism**: no unnecessary overhead, just the essentials

Itâ€™s a library shaped by the belief that tools should stay out of the way and let developers focus on their own logic.

## Learn more

The full documentation, installation instructions, and examples live on [GitHub](https://github.com/csanfilippo/aral).  
Youâ€™ll also find the package published on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/it.calogerosanfilippos/aral).

## Looking ahead

This is just the beginning. aral will continue to evolve, and Iâ€™d love to hear from anyone who tries it out. Feedback, ideas, and contributions are all welcome.
