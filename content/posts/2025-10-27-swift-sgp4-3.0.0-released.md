Version **3.0.0** of `swift-sgp4` is now available.  
This release introduces support for **Linux** and **Android**, expahunding the library beyond Apple platforms.

## Background

`swift-sgp4` provides Swift bindings to the [SGP4 orbital propagation library](https://github.com/dnwrnr/sgp4).  
Earlier versions relied on an Objective-C++ wrapper around the C++ implementation, which limited the project to iOS and macOS.

## What Changed

- **Objective-C++ wrapper removed**  
  The previous bridge was tied to Apple platforms and prevented portability.

- **C++ wrapper introduced**  
  A new C++ interface now wraps the SGP4 core, enabling use across multiple platforms.

- **New platform support**  
  In addition to iOS and macOS, the library now builds and runs on **Linux** and **Android**.
- 

## Migration Notes

- Existing Swift APIs remain unchanged.
- No code modifications are required for current users.
- To adopt the new version, update your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/csanfilippo/swift-sgp4.git", from: "3.0.0")
```
