Version **0.3.0** of [aral](/projects/aral) is out — and it brings **JVM support**.

## Expanding the reach

Until now, aral has focused on mobile and embedded platforms: Android, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, macOS. With this release, it steps confidently into the **JVM world**, making it usable in desktop apps, server-side Kotlin, and even scripting environments.

This means you can now use aral in:

- Kotlin/JVM projects
- Spring Boot services
- CLI tools and desktop utilities
- Anywhere the JVM runs
