Version **3.0.0** of TurinPark is now available on iOS.

This release marks a significant step in the project’s evolution: the app has been **rewritten from scratch** with a new architecture based on a **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) core**. While the user interface remains fully native on iOS, the underlying logic is now shared in a way that will make it easier to extend the app to other platforms.

### What’s New
- **Complete rewrite** of the application with a KMP core
- **Native iOS UI** built on top of shared logic
- The app make use of  [**aral**](/libs/aral) to parse the XML data feed

### Why KMP
The move to Kotlin Multiplatform allows us to consolidate the app’s business logic in a single, shared codebase. This approach reduces duplication, improves maintainability, and makes it possible to deliver consistent behavior across platforms while keeping the user experience native.

### Looking Ahead
The long-term goal is to release an **Android version of TurinPark**. Thanks to the new architecture, the Android app will be able to reuse the same KMP core, ensuring that both iOS and Android versions share the same logic while maintaining their own native UIs.

### Installation
TurinPark 3.0.0 is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/turinpark/id500484546).
