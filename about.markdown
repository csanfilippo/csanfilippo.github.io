![TurinParkIcon](/assets/me.jpeg){: width="250" }{: style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;" } Hi! I'm Calogero Sanfilippo.

I'm a software engineer from Italy, currently working as a Senior Software engineer at [Gucci](https://www.gucci.com).

I'll use this space for telling you about the apps I develop in my spare time, to experiment new features and development patterns.
